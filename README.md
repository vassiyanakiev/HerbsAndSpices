WebApplication Task 
Herbs And Spices - ECommerce Shop Listing 

Vasilena Georgieva 

The task was the creation of a project that presents information about products i.e. online shop. 

The chosen technologies are: ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, Bootstrap 4.1.1 ASP.NET MVC was used to build the backend of the application. 
jQuery was used to iterate over the data and build the structural HTML. 
Bootstrap was used to style the result since it came with the template and seemed convenient enough to learn. 
Since the data format was easier to use in JS that C# I used jQuery to build the grid and card view. 

Two pictures were included to personalize the task and illustrate where the creation of this project took place - Bezbog.
